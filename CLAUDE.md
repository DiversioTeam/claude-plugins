@AGENTS.md

## Notes

This `CLAUDE.md` intentionally sources `AGENTS.md` so that requirements,
commands, and agent behavior live in a single source of truth for this repo.

For Claude Code best practices on `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` in web-based repos,
see:
- https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/claude-code-on-the-web#best-practices

Relevant guidance (summarized):
- Document requirements: clearly specify dependencies and commands for the
  project.
- If you have an `AGENTS.md` file, you can source it in your `CLAUDE.md` using
  `@AGENTS.md` to maintain a single source of truth.
